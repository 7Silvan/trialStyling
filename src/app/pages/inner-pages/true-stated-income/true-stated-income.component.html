            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>$200,000 </strong> as a down payment.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>PITI Reserves </strong> of 6 months - $41,000</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Average Closing Costs </strong>totaling $24,000. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Revolving Debts </strong> of $1,000 per month for 5 years - $60,000 </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>The above numbers break down as follow:</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Total </strong> $325,000</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Loan Requested</strong> $800,000</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Total Required in thank or in Other Assets</strong> $1,125,000</p>
              </li>

            </ul>
